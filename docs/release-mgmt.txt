Managing New Releases of AInspector Sidebar

----------------------------------------------------------------
Goals:

Use a phased approach that provides adequate testing before making
the final version publicly available.

1. First publish an internal release candidate for testing and request
   that issues be entered at opena11y/fae-ainspector

2. After reviewing any issues that were identified, either address
   them and loop back to step one, or proceed to the next step.

3. Publish the final release version.


----------------------------------------------------------------
Publish Release Candidate:

1. Check in the changes to Subversion
   a. Ensure that maxVersion is up to date
   b. Version ID may have "-beta.n" suffix

2. Create the XPI file
   a. Ensure desired version of OAA Evaluation Library is in place
   b. Filename may have "-beta.n" before ".xpi"
   c. Run the build script

3. Install and test the XPI in Firefox

4. Add the release notes to the ainspector.github.io

5. Upload the XPI to github.com/ainspector/releases

6. Send testing request email with inclusion of release notes
